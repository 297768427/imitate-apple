          All battery claims depend on network configuration and many other
          factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles
          and may eventually need to be replaced by an Apple service provider.
          Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. See
          apple.com/au/batteries and apple.com/au/iphone/battery for more
          information. iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone XR, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone
          11 Pro Max and iPhone 11 are splash-, water- and dust-resistant, and
          were tested under controlled laboratory conditions. iPhone 11 Pro and
          iPhone 11 Pro Max have a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529
          (maximum depth of 4 metres for up to 30 minutes); iPhone 11 has a
          rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 2 metres for
          up to 30 minutes); and iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone XR have a
          rating of IP67 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 1 metre for
          up to 30 minutes). Splash, water and dust resistance are not permanent
          conditions, and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear.
          Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for
          cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage is not covered under
          warranty but you might have rights under consumer law. Screen size is
          measured diagonally. The iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone 11
          and iPhone XR displays have rounded corners that follow a beautiful
          curved design, and these corners are within a standard rectangle. When
          measured as a standard rectangular shape, the screen is 5.85 inches
          (iPhone 11 Pro), 6.46 inches (iPhone 11 Pro Max) or 6.06 inches
          (iPhone 11 and iPhone XR) diagonally. Actual viewable area is less.
